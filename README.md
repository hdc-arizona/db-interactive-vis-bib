# An annotated bibliography of vis and data bases

This repo hosts a live version of the bibliography described in the
InfoVis 2020 paper [A Structured Review of Data Management Technology
for Interactive Visualization and
Analysis](https://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/projects/end-to-end-visual-big-data/db-tech-for-interactive-vis/).

## tl;dr

Here's the annotated [BibTeX file](vis-db.bib). If you want to search it interactively, you can use the [website](https://hdc-arizona.github.io/db-interactive-vis-bib/).

## Annotations

We intend to keep the bibliography annotations lightweight, and limited to the `keywords` key in the BibTeX entries. We have the following tags:

* `implementation-aggregate`
* `implementation-aqp`
* `implementation-compression`
* `implementation-data-parallel`
* `implementation-db-application`
* `implementation-index`
* `implementation-materialized-views`
* `implementation-mqo`
* `implementation-progressive`
* `implementation-provenance`
* `implementation-spatial-index`
* `implementation-survey`
* `implementation-user-modeling`
* `interaction-aggregate`
* `interaction-change`
* `interaction-derive`
* `interaction-encode`
* `interaction-filter`
* `interaction-navigate`
* `interaction-select`

"implementation" tags are (a superset of) the columns we presented in
the paper. "interaction" tags correspond to the interactive task that
the technique supports. If you're planning on contributing to the
bibliography, we ask that you use the tags above.

With that said, if you want to make the case for a new interaction or
implementation tag, please create a new issue on the repo!

## Please contribute

The bibliography we report on our VIS 2020 paper is consistent with
the criteria we chose at the beginning of the project. On the other
hand, we think there's a lot of value in keeping this up to date with
new work, as well as references we might have missed.
